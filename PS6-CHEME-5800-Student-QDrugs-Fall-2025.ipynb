    "The Drug Cocktail Design Problem involves selecting a combination of drugs to create a cocktail that maximizes therapeutic effectiveness while staying within budget and safety constraints. Each drug has attributes such as dosage, mechanism of action, and side effects, which contribute to the overall effectiveness of the cocktail. The drug cocktail design problem can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\n",

    "### Test case 3: Tight safety constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Test:__ \n",
    "> What happens when even the minimum dosage of a single drug exceeds the safety limit? Set a low safety limit, e.g., $S = 10$ or $S = 5$ mg/kg-day, while keeping the budget generous. Retrain the agent with this tight safety constraint and analyze the resulting policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check whether the policy respects the safety constraint by keeping $\\sum_{i}n_{i} \\leq S$ even when the budget allows for expensive high-dose drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer__: Describe what happened in test case 3 here .... \n",
    "\n",
    "1. when set S = 10, budget = 1000:\n",
    "\n",
    "The learned policy still respects the safety constraint. In the optimal action for state 15, the agent chooses drug 1 at high dose (5.0 mg/kg), drug 2 at low dose (1.0 mg/kg), and drug 3 at nominal dose (2.3 mg/kg), so the total exposure is 8.3, which is smaller than 10. Although the budget would allow multiple high-dose drugs, the policy avoids any combination that make S >10, because such actions incur a large safety penalty. As a result, the agent settles on a mixed-dose combination that stays within the safety limit, leading to a small negative Q-value rather than the very large negative values associated with violating the safety constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. when set S = 5, budget = 1000:\n",
    "\n",
    "The learned policy chooses only a single drug at high dose (drug 1, 5.0 mg/kg). The total exposure is exactly 5, so the safety constraint is strictly enforced. Although the budget would allow multiple high-dose drugs, any additional drug would push above the safety limit and incur a large penalty. As a result, the agent concentrates the entire allowable dose on one drug and completely avoids combination therapies."

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lab, we applied Q-learning to solve the drug cocktail design problem, learning optimal policies for selecting drug combinations and dosage levels under budget constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Q-learning for combinatorial optimization**: We implemented a Q-learning agent that iteratively estimates state-action value functions through temporal difference updates, converging to an optimal policy without requiring explicit knowledge of transition probabilities or reward functions. The algorithm balanced exploration (trying new drug combinations) with exploitation (selecting known effective combinations) using an epsilon-greedy strategy with a decaying exploration rate.\n",
    "> * **MDP formulation for drug design**: We encoded the drug cocktail problem as a Markov decision process with states representing dosage level configurations (high, nominal, low for each drug type), actions representing binary drug selection vectors, and rewards computed from Cobb-Douglas utility functions penalized for budget violations. This formulation captured both therapeutic effectiveness (through preference parameters γᵢ) and resource constraints (through budget limits).\n",
    "> * **Policy extraction and interpretation**: We derived the optimal policy by selecting argmax actions from the converged Q-value table, mapping each state to the drug combination that maximizes expected cumulative reward. The learned policy encoded both drug selection decisions (which drugs to include) and dosage optimization (which concentration levels to use), demonstrating how reinforcement learning discovers structured solutions to constrained combinatorial problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning provides a framework for sequential decision-making in optimization problems where the relationship between actions and outcomes must be learned through experience rather than analytical derivation.\n",
